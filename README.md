# 100Day-Challenges-Python-Beginner-to-Expert
100Day-Challenges-Python-Beginner-to-Expert is a structured challenge-based learning journey. Over 100 days, tackle Python fundamentals, data structures, OOP, libraries like NumPy and Pandas, and real-world data science tasks. Perfect for beginners to advanced learners aiming to master Python progressively.

Welcome to the 100Day-Challenges-Python-Beginner-to-Expert repository, a structured, challenge-based learning journey for Python enthusiasts eager to strengthen their programming skills. This repository is crafted for beginners looking to grasp the basics and professionals aiming to hone their expertise in Python and its applications in data science.

The challenge is designed for 100 days of consistent learning and coding practice. Each day presents a new problem or project that focuses on various core and advanced concepts, including:

- Python fundamentals: Variables, loops, conditionals, functions, file handling, and more.
Data structures and algorithms: Lists, dictionaries, tuples, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, and searching algorithms.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
Modules and Libraries: Familiarization with Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and more for handling data.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Data cleaning, visualization, and building simple models using libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
Real-life Projects: Mini-projects that apply learned concepts to real-world scenarios, preparing you for challenges in data analysis and automation.
This repository follows a progressive learning path, where the complexity of tasks increases as the days go by, ensuring that learners build a strong foundation before diving into advanced topics. All challenges come with detailed instructions, code samples, and solutions, making it easier to track your progress and learn by doing.

By the end of the 100 days, you will not only be comfortable writing Python code but also understand how to apply it in various fields, from general programming to data science and machine learning.

Feel free to fork this repository, contribute your own challenges, and share your progress with the community. Let's embark on this exciting journey and master Python, one challenge at a time!
